This tweak is based on u/apieceoflint's PasteAndGo tweak, so please go support him as well. ;)

The tweak aims to add some cool features to the original one, such as:
- Support for more web browsers, such as Firefox, Firefox Focus, Google Chrome, and more!

- Support for more languages such as Spanish, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Dutch, and more that I will be adding!

- If the item copied is not a URL but just a normal word, search it with the preferred search engine.
