# PasteAndGo 2 | Paste & Search actions for the force touch menu
PasteAndGo 2 is a tweak for jailbroken iOS devices running iOS 11.3.1 to 13.3, that adds the ability to directly open a link or search a word
from the force touch menu of several browsers.

It is based on [u/apieceoflint's](https://reddit.com/u/apieceoflint)'s' PasteAndGo tweak, and aims to add some cool features to the it, such as:
- Support for more web browsers, such as Firefox, Brave, Google Chrome, and more!

- Support for more languages such as Spanish, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Dutch, and more that I will be adding!

- If the item copied is not a URL but just a normal word, search it with the search engine of preference.

 - Chrome
 - Edge
 - Firefox
 - Firefox Focus
 - Brave
